# Data Engineering Udacity
This repo contains the four (currently only 2) projects of the Data Engineering Nanodegree of Udacity.
The projects' code is written in python using the corresponding libraries and sdks for each
tool used: Postgres, Cassandra, Redshift, Spark and Airflow.

## 1 - Data Modelling
#### Data Modelling with Postgres
Modelling of user activity data to create a database and ETL pipeline in Postgres for a musing straming app.

#### Data Modelling with Apache Cassandra
Modeling of event data to create a non-relational database and ETL pipeline for a music streaming app.

## 2 - Cloud Data Warehouses
Construction of a pipeline that extracts data from S3, stages them in Redshift and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for the analytics team.
